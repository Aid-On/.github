## Mission
As we approach the day when AI surpasses human knowledge,  
we believe that "willpower" and "passion" are what humans possess  
that AI lacks.  

With a mission to support this essential 'willpower and passion'  
through AI technology for the future,  
we challenge ourselves to create new societies and businesses.
