# Aid-On README

## Mission

### **Build Partners, Not Just AI.**

Creating a society where humans and AI elevate each other, instantly transforming will into action.

- **"Partners" not "AI"** – Dissolving information barriers, enabling everyone to accelerate their aspirations.  
- **Human × AI Collaboration** – Converting individual passion into social driving force, sharing success experiences.

## Vision

### **From Miyazaki, Making Human-AI Collaboration the Global Standard.**

Expanding locally refined models nationwide, then globally.

1. **Miyazaki Proof → National → Global** – Solving regional challenges and scaling as reproducible models.  
2. **Circular Knowledge Network** – AI and humans share learning, defense, and optimization, turning even failures into assets.  
3. **Open Process** – Transparency invites new challenges and growth.

## Values

### **Human × AI is Fascinating.**

Powered by "partnership," accelerating challenges and evolving together with AI and humans as dual engines.

### Aid-On Principles

1. **Information is Open**  
   - **Why**: Eliminating information asymmetry to maximize collaboration speed.  
   - **Behaviors**: Documents and data are open by default, shared channels before individual consultations, leaving decision rationale.

2. **Keep the Feedback Loop Running**  
   - **Why**: Making uncertainty an ally and maximizing learning. Success and failure are both delicious meals!  
   - **Behaviors**: Try → Measure → Learn → Improve loop, regular synchronization, sharing success and failure stories.

3. **Rely on AI Without Hesitation**  
   - **Why**: Concentrating human resources on creativity.  
   - **Behaviors**: Consider AI utilization before starting work, automate repetitive tasks, always evaluate AI suggestions.
